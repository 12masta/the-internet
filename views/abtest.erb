  <h3>A/B Test</h3>

    Also known as split testing. This is a way in which businesses are able to simultaneously test and learn different versions of a page to see which text and/or functionality works best towards a desired outcome (e.g. a user action such as a click-through).

    Simply refresh the page to see a different version.
